	abstract = {ABSTRACT We describe the prevailing model of musical expression, which assumes a binary formulation of "the text" and "the act," along with its implied roles of composer and performer. We argue that this model not only excludes some contemporary aesthetic values but also limits the communicative ability of new music interfaces. As an alternative, an ecology of musical creation accounts for both a diversity of aesthetic goals and the complex interrelation of human and non-human agents. An ecological perspective on several approaches to musical creation with interactive technologies reveals an expanded, more inclusive view of artistic interaction that facilitates novel, compelling ways to use technology for music. This paper is fundamentally a call to consider the role of aesthetic values in the analysis of artistic processes and technologies.},

	abstract = {Understanding the question of what makes a good musical instrument raises several conceptual challenges. Researchers have regularly adopted tools from traditional HCI as a framework to address this issue, in which instrumental musical activities are taken to comprise a device and a user, and should be evaluated as such. We argue that this approach is not equipped to fully address the conceptual issues raised by this question. It is worth reflecting on what exactly an instrument is, and how instruments contribute toward meaningful musical experiences. Based on a theoretical framework that incorporates ideas from ecological psychology, enactivism, and phenomenology, we propose an alternative approach to studying musical instruments. According to this approach, instruments are better understood in terms of processes rather than as devices, while musicians are not users, but rather agents in musical ecologies. A consequence of this reframing is that any evaluations of instruments, if warranted, should align with the specificities of the relevant processes and ecologies concerned. We present an outline of this argument and conclude with a description of a current research project to illustrate how our approach can shape the design and performance of a musical instrument in-progress.},

	abstract = {Moving to music is an essential human pleasure particularly related to musical groove. Structurally, music associated with groove is often characterised by rhythmic complexity in the form of syncopation, frequently observed in musical styles such as funk, hip-hop and electronic dance music. Structural complexity has been related to positive affect in music more broadly, but the function of syncopation in eliciting pleasure and body-movement in groove is unknown. Here we report results from a web-based survey which investigated the relationship between syncopation and ratings of wanting to move and experienced pleasure. Participants heard funk drum-breaks with varying degrees of syncopation and audio entropy, and rated the extent to which the drum-breaks made them want to move and how much pleasure they experienced. While entropy was found to be a poor predictor of wanting to move and pleasure, the results showed that medium degrees of syncopation elicited the most desire to move and the most pleasure, particularly for participants who enjoy dancing to music. Hence, there is an inverted U-shaped relationship between syncopation, body-movement and pleasure, and syncopation seems to be an important structural factor in embodied and affective responses to groove.},

We explore this NIME topic in the context of building the first iteration of an augmented acoustic guitar prototype for percussive fingerstyle guitarists. The first author, himself a percussive fingerstyle player, started the project of an augmented guitar with expectations and assumptions made around his own playing style, and in particular around the arrangement of one song. This input was complemented by the outcome of an interview study, in which percussive guitarists highlighted functional and creative requirements to suit their needs. We ran a pilot study to assess the resulting prototype, involving two other players. We present their feedback on two configurations of the prototype, one equalising the signal of surface sensors and the other based on sample triggering. The equalisation-based setting was better received, however both participants provided useful suggestions to improve the sample-triggering model following their own auditory imagery.},

We present two use cases investigating how audio content retrieved from Freesound can be leveraged by performers or audiences to produce accompanying soundtracks for music performance with a smart mandolin. In the performer-instrument interaction use case, the performer can select content to be retrieved prior to performing through a set of keywords and structure it in order to create the desired accompaniment. In the performer-audience interaction use case, a group of audience members participates in the music creation by selecting and arranging Freesound audio content to create an accompaniment collaboratively. We discuss the advantages and limitations of the system with regard to music making and audience participation, along with its implications and challenges.},

First-year university students (n = 45) worked on a group composition task during three meetings. Each time the students met, they completed a detailed questionnaire that assessed aspects of each student's experience of the group compositional process using an ‘experience sampling form’ based on Csikszentmihalyi's previous work. Completed compositions were recorded and rated for quality and creativity by the participants and by a group of music education specialists (n= 24). Results indicated a number of ways in which the specialists’ assessments of quality related to the students’ assessments of creativity and flow. The study provides an example of a research method that can be used to further our understanding of the processes and outcomes of group music composition tasks. The discussion also considers a number of important ways that the concept of flow can be utilized within a music education context.},

The ﬁrst approach is primarily based on reﬂections by an individual performer/developer (auto-ethnography) and the second on interviews and observations. The rationales for both approaches are presented along with ﬁndings from research which applied them in order to illustrate and explore the characteristics of both. Challenges, including the diﬃculty of balancing rigour and relevance and the risks of negatively impacting on creative practices are articulated, as are the potential beneﬁts.},

In the first, I review two influential theories from the Philosophy of Science to help reflect on the nature of design theory, concluding that research through design is likely to produce theories that are provisional, contingent, and aspirational. In the second part, I discuss three possible interpretations for the diversity of approaches to research through design, and suggest that this variation need not be seen as a sign of inadequate standards or a lack of cumulative progress in the field, but may be natural for a generative endeavour. In the final section, I suggest that, rather than aiming to develop increasingly comprehensive theories of design, practice based research might better view theory as annotation of realised design examples, and particularly portfolios of related pieces. Overall, I suggest that the design research community should be wary of impulses towards convergence and standardisation, and instead take pride in its aptitude for exploring and speculating, particularising and diversifying, and - especially - its ability to manifest the results in the form of new, conceptually rich artefacts.},

	abstract = {Electronic music evokes new sensations, feelings, and thoughts in both composers and listeners. Opening the door to an unlimited universe of sound, it engages spatialization as an integral aspect of composition and focuses on sound transformation as a core structural strategy. In this new domain, pitch occurs as a flowing and ephemeral substance that can be bent, modulated, or dissolved into noise. Similarly, time occurs not merely as a fixed duration subdivided by ratios, but as a plastic medium that can be generated, modulated, reversed, warped, scrambled, and granulated. Envelope and waveform undulations on all time scales interweave to generate form. The power of algorithmic methods amplify the capabilities of music technology. Taken together, these constitute game-changing possibilities. This convergence of technical and aesthetic trends prompts the need for a new text focused on the opportunities of a sound oriented, multiscale approach to composition of electronic music. Sound oriented means a practice that takes place in the presence of sound. Multiscale means an approach that takes into account the perceptual and physical reality of multiple, interacting time scales-each of which can be composed. After more than a century of research and development, now is an appropriate moment to step back and reevaluate all that has changed under the ground of artistic practice. Composing Electronic Music outlines a new theory of composition based on the toolkit of electronic music techniques. The theory consists of a framework of concepts and a vocabulary of terms describing musical materials, their transformation, and their organization. Central to this discourse is the notion of narrative structure in composition-how sounds are born, interact, transform, and die. It presents a guidebook: a tour of facts, history, commentary, opinions, and pointers to interesting ideas and new possibilities to consider and explore.},

	shorttitle = {Mars by 1980},
	abstract = {Electronic music is now ubiquitous, from mainstream pop hits to the furthest reaches of the avant-garde. The future, a long time coming, finally arrived. But how did we get here? In Mars by 1980, David Stubbs charts the evolution of electronic music from the earliest mechanical experiments in the late nineteenth century to the pre-World War 1 inventions of the Futurist Luigi Russolo, author of the 'Art Of Noises' manifesto. He takes us through the musique concrète of radical composers such as Edgard Varèse, Pierre Schaeffer, and Karlheinz Stockhausen, to the gradual absorption of electronic instrumentation into the mainstream: be it through the BBC Radiophonic Workshop and the work of pioneers like Delia Derbyshire, grandiose prog rock, or the more DIY approach of electronica, house, and techno. It's a tale of mavericks and future dreamers overcoming Luddite resistance, malfunctioning devices, and sonic mayhem. Its beginnings are in the world of avant-classical composition, but the book also encompasses the cosmic funk of Stevie Wonder, Giorgio Moroder, and unforgettable 80s electronic pop from the likes of Depeche Mode, the Pet Shop Boys, and Laurie Anderson - right up to present day innovators on the underground scene. But above all, it's an essential story of authenticity: is this music? Is it legitimate? What drew its creators to make it? Where does it stand, in relation to rock and pop, classical and jazz music, to the modern society that generated it? And why does it resonate more strongly than ever in our own postmodern, seemingly post-futurist times? Mars by 1980 is the definitive account that answers these questions.},

This report describes three lines of research relevant to this issue, namely, the effects of: (1) focused music listening on subsequent task performance (the Mozart effect); (2) music instruction; and (3) background music listening. Research suggests that while Mozart effect studies have attracted considerable media attention, the effect cannot be reliably demonstrated in children. In contrast, music instruction confers consistent benefits for spatiotemporal reasoning skills; however, improvements in associated academic domains, such as arithmetic, have not been reliably shown. Finally, background music may calm and focus children with special education needs, thereby enhancing learning. Additional research is required to determine whether this effect is evident in normal populations. Overall, evidence for the non‐musical benefits of music listening and instruction is limited. The inherent value of music and music education should not be overlooked by narrowly focusing on cognitive and academic outcomes.},

	abstract = {Even the smartest among us can feel inept as we fail to figure out which light switch or oven burner to turn on, or whether to push, pull, or slide a door. The fault, argues this ingenious,even liberating,book, lies not in ourselves, but in product design that ignores the needs of users and the principles of cognitive psychology. The problems range from ambiguous and hidden controls to arbitrary relationships between controls and functions, coupled with a lack of feedback or other assistance and unreasonable demands on memorization. The Design of Everyday Things shows that good, usable design is possible. The rules are simple: make things visible, exploit natural relationships that couple function and control, and make intelligent use of constraints. The goal: guide the user effortlessly to the right action on the right control at the right time.In this entertaining and insightful analysis, cognitive scientist Don Norman hails excellence of design as the most important key to regaining the competitive edge in influencing consumer behaviour. Now fully expanded and updated, with a new introduction by the author, The Design of Everyday Things is a powerful primer on how,and why,some products satisfy customers while others only frustrate them.},

With emphasis on new ideas for improvement and arguments for wider implementation in future, a unique combination of leading opinions on inclusive design from both industry and academia are offered. The theme throughout encourages a positive view of inclusive design as a good and profitable process and to produce a change to more effective approaches to "design for all". Inclusive Design is composed of two parts with a common chapter structure so that the business and design arguments in favour of inclusive design can be easily compared and assimilated: The Business Case presents the industrial and management benefits of inclusive design. It concentrates on demographic, legal and ethical reasons for all businesses being better off taking inclusivity into account in the design of their products or services. Case histories demonstrating the commercial success of inclusive design are drawn from the experiences of companies such as Tesco, Fiat and The Royal Mail. The Designers' Case focuses on the factors a designer needs to take into account when dealing with inclusivity. "Who is going to use my design?" "What do they need from my design?" "How do I take any medical needs into account?" "Just how "inclusive" is my design?" are all questions answered in this section which presents the necessary tools for effective inclusive design. This part of the book aims to convince a designer that inclusive design is a realistic goal. Inclusive Design will appeal to designers, researchers and students and to managers making decisions about the research and design strategies of their companies.},

of Things, sensory technology and web interfaces. This chapter aims to provide 
sound designers with theoretical principles and practical skills to understand and 
develop new musical instruments featuring intelligent sensing and Internet 
connectivity, the so-called smart musical instruments (SMIs). After reviewing related 
works on augmented instruments and networked music performance systems, we 
describe the key concepts related to smart musical instruments which combine (i) 
sensing/actuating, (ii) artificial intelligence enabling proactivity and context 
awareness properties, (iii) network connectivity, and (iv) interoperability. By 
appropriate use of sensor technology and embedded systems, it is possible to turn a 
traditional musical instrument into a smart musical instrument or design a new 
interface for musical expression from scratch that can react and adapt to performers’ 
gestures and context in programmable ways. The self-contained nature of SMIs 
provides 21st century musicians with appealing interactive and expressive 
possibilities in networked computer music setups. The second part of the chapter 
takes the form of a tutorial enabling the reader aiming to develop maker technology 
skills to start crafting a simple SMI interface.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a pattern language for user experiences in live coding. It uses a recently defined analytic framework that has developed out of the Cognitive Dimensions of Notations and related approaches. The focus on performance programming offers particular value in its potential to construct rigorous accounts of the experiences of both performers (the live coder) and audiences. Although developed as an account of live coding, the findings promise to be relevant to a wider range of performance programming contexts, which could benefit from analysis in terms of live coding, if a systematic framework of this kind were available. The paper provides a detailed analytic commentary, drawing on the broadly diverse body of prior live coding practice, but using music live coding as a central running example. The findings demonstrate the advantage of rigorous analysis from an independent theoretical perspective, and suggest the potential for future work that might draw on this pattern language as a basis for empirical investigations of user experience, and as a theoretical grounding in practice-led design of new live coding languages and tools.},

	abstract = {Since the guitar was first electrified in the 1930s, it has become an American icon and has transformed the soundtrack of our lives with its wide range of sounds―from seductive twang to howling distortion. Relatively inexpensive, easy to learn, and fun to play, the electric guitar is a truly democratic instrument. Millions have purchased Rickenbackers, Gibsons, Fenders, and other brands of guitars over the decades, fueling daydreams of fame and fortune.In The Electric Guitar: A History of an American Icon, scholars working in American studies, business history, the history of technology, and musicology come together to explore the electric guitar's importance as an invention and its peculiar place in American culture. Documenting the critical and ever-evolving relationship among inventors, craftsmen, musicians, businessmen, music writers, and fans, the contributors look at the guitar not just as an instrument, but as a mass-produced consumer good that changed the sound of popular music and the self image of musicians.Avoiding the familiar stories, The Electric Guitar covers the careers and influence of guitar heroes such as Buddy Holly and Jimi Hendrix, but it also looks at lesser known but equally influential guitarists, such as Sister Rosetta Tharpe and Ike Turner. It also explains the importance of record producers such as Lee Hazlewood, effects pioneers like Roger Mayer, and electronics engineers such as Jim Marshall―all of whom played vital parts in constructing the sounds we associate with the electric guitar. From inventor's workbench to factory floor to recording studio, André Millard and his colleagues trace the development of the instrument, its use across musical genres, and its profound impact on popular culture and American identity.},

	abstract = {Psychologists tend to see creativity exclusively as a mental process. In this chapter, I will propose that such an approach cannot do justice to the phenomenon of creativity, which is as much a cultural and social as it is a psychological event. To develop this perspective, I will use a “systems” model of the creative process that takes into account its essential features.Creativity research in recent years has been increasingly informed by a systems perspective. Starting with the observations of Morris Stein (1953, 1963) and the extensive data presented by Dean Simonton (1988, 1990) showing the influence of economic, political, and social events on the rates of creative production, it has become increasingly clear that variables external to the individual must be taken into account if one wishes to explain why, when, and where new ideas or products arise from and become established in a culture (Gruber, 1988; Harrington, 1990). Magyari-Beck (1988) has gone so far as to suggest that because of its complexity, creativity needs a new discipline of “creatology” in order to be thoroughly understood.The systems approach developed here has been described before and applied to historical and anecdotal examples, as well as to data collected to answer a variety of different questions (Csikszentmihalyi, 1988b, 1990, 1996; Csikszentmihalyi, Rathunde, \&amp; Whalen, 1993; Csikszentmihalyi \&amp; Sawyer, 1995; Feldman, Csikszentmihalyi, \&amp; Gardner, 1994).},

Drawing on nearly one hundred interviews with exceptional people, from biologists and physicists, to politicians and business leaders, to poets and artists, as well as his thirty years of research on the subject, Csikszentmihalyi uses his famous flow theory to explore the creative process. He discusses such ideas as why creative individuals are often seen as selfish and arrogant, and why the tortured genius is largely a myth. Most important, he explains why creativity needs to be cultivated and is necessary for the future of our country, if not the world.},

	abstract = {Learning violin is a challenging task requiring execution of pitch tasks with the left hand 
using a strong aural feedback loop for correctly adjusting pitch, concurrent with the right hand 
moving a bow precisely with correct pressure across strings. Real-time technological assistance 
can help a student gain feedback and understanding helpful for learning and maintaining 
motivation. This thesis presents real-time low-cost low-latency violin augmentations that can 
be used to assist learning the violin along with other real-time performance tasks. 
To capture bow performance, we demonstrate a new means of bow tracking by measuring bow 
hair de 
ection from the bow hair being pressed against the string. Using near- eld optical 
sensors placed along the bow we are able to estimate bow position and pressure through linear 
regression from training samples. For left hand pitch tracking, we introduce low cost means for 
tracking  nger position and illustrate the combination of sensed results with audio processing 
to achieve high accuracy low-latency pitch tracking. We subsequently verify our new tracking 
methods' e ectiveness and usefulness demonstrating low-latency note onset detection and 
control of real-time performance visuals. 
To help tackle the challenge of intonation, we used our pitch estimation to develop low latency 
pitch correction. Using expert performers, we veri ed that fully correcting pitch is not 
only disconcerting but breaks a violinist's learned pitch feedback loop resulting in worse asplayed 
performance. However, partial pitch correction, though also linked to worse as-played 
performance, did not lead to a signi cantly negative experience con rming its potential for 
use to temporarily reduce barriers to success. Subsequently, in a study with beginners, we 
veri ed that when the pitch feedback loop is underdeveloped, automatic pitch correction did 
not signi cantly hinder performance, but o ered an enjoyable low-pitch error experience and 
that providing an automatic target guide pitch was helpful in correcting performed pitch 
error.},

Davidson asks continuously and with a committed intensity 'where a disability ends and the social order begins' . . . this book brings the study of poetry and poetics into the twenty-first century." ---Rachel Blau DuPlessis, Temple University Concerto for the Left Hand is at the cutting edge of the expanding field of disability studies, offering a wide range of essays that investigate the impact of disability across various art forms---including literature, performance, photography, and film. Rather than simply focusing on the ways in which disabled persons are portrayed, Michael Davidson explores how the experience of disability shapes the work of artists and why disability serves as a vital lens through which to interpret modern culture. Covering an eclectic range of topics---from the phantom missing limb in film noir to the poetry of American Sign Language---this collection delivers a unique and engaging assessment of the interplay between disability and aesthetics. Written in a fluid, accessible style, Concerto for the Left Hand will appeal to both specialists and general audiences. With its interdisciplinary approach, this book should appeal not only to scholars of disability studies but to all those working in minority art, deaf studies, visual culture, and modernism.

@phdthesis{nash_supporting_2012,
	title = {Supporting {Virtuosity} and {Flow} in {Computer} {Music}},
	abstract = {As we begin to realise the sonic and expressive potential of the computer, HCI
researchers face the challenge of designing rewarding and accessible user experiences
that enable individuals to explore complex creative domains such as music.
 In performance-based music systems such as sequencers, a disjunction exists
between the musician’s specialist skill with performance hardware and the generic
usability techniques applied in the design of the software. The creative process is not
only fragmented across multiple physical (and virtual) devices, but divided across
creativity and productivity phases separated by the act of recording.
 Integrating psychologies of expertise and intrinsic motivation, this thesis proposes a
design shift from usability to virtuosity, using theories of “flow” (Csikszentmihalyi,
1996) and feedback “liveness” (Tanimoto, 1990) to identify factors that facilitate
learning and creativity in digital notations and interfaces, leading to a set of design
heuristics to support virtuosity in notation use. Using the cognitive dimensions of
notations framework (Green, 1996), models of the creative user experience are
developed, working towards a theoretical framework for HCI in music systems, and
specifically computer-aided composition.
 Extensive analytical methods are used to look at corollaries of virtuosity and flow in
real-world computer music interaction, notably in soundtracking, a software-based
composing environment offering a rapid edit-audition feedback cycle, enabled by the
user’s skill in manipulating the text-based notation (and program) through the
computer keyboard. The interaction and development of more than 1,000 sequencer
and tracker users was recorded over a period of 2 years, to investigate the nature and
development of skill and technique, look for evidence of flow experiences, and
establish the use and role of both visual and musical feedback in music software.
Quantitative analyses of interaction data are supplemented with a detailed video study
of a professional tracker composer, and a user survey that draws on psychometric
methods to evaluate flow experiences in the use of digital music notations, such as
sequencers and trackers.
 Empirical findings broadly support the proposed design heuristics, and enable the
development of further models of liveness and flow in notation use. Implications for
UI design are discussed in the context of existing music systems, and supporting
digitally-mediated creativity in other domains based on notation use.},

The augmentation of guitar is done by adding a customisable guitar MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) controller to the guitar body. Different parameters of the guitar effects can be changed by different hand gestures. This will provide a guitarist multiple dimensions of control for different effects parameters. Other than that, machine learning approach is used to recognise the artist who is playing the guitar. This would help to provide an even more personalised experience. A user study is conducted to find the 2-dimensional position of the guitar while each artist is playing the instrument. This method is only applicable to closed data set. So, for example, this can be implemented for all the members of a band. This technique can even be used for giving passwords to individual instruments; which then turn on or open a special effect patch only when the corresponding artist pick up the instrument. This research paper will take the reader through the full design process of the augmented guitar. In addition, this paper also discusses more about MIDI protocols for guitar augmentation. Other than this, the steps involved in creating the dataset for mapping the guitar in 2dimensional space is also discussed in this research article.},

Its foundations lie in the use of the guitar’s body for percussive lines, and in the extended range given by the novel use of altered tunings. There are very few formal accounts of percussive ﬁngerstyle, therefore, we devised an interview study to investigate its approach to composition, performance and musical experimentation. Our aim was to gain insight into the technique from a gesture-based point of view, observe whether modern ﬁngerstyle shares similarities to the approaches in NIME practice and investigate possible avenues for guitar augmentations inspired by the percussive technique. We conducted an inductive thematic analysis on the transcribed interviews: our ﬁndings highlight the participants’ material-based approach to musical interaction and we present a three-zone model of the most common percussive gestures on the guitar’s body. Furthermore, we examine current trends in Digital Musical Instruments, especially in guitar augmentation, and we discuss possible future directions in augmented guitars in light of the interviewees’ perspectives.},

Guitar tablatures, a form of music notation showing instrument ﬁngerings, are mined from the web and their chord sequences are extracted. The tablatures are then clustered based on the songs’ chord sequences complexity so that guitarists can pick up those adapted to their performance skills.},

	abstract = {Ubiquitous music (UbiMus) proposes to study how social interaction with mobile and distributed technologies can converge to form novel creativity support tools and music artistic practices. A recent field overlapping with UbiMus is the Internet of Musical Things, which refers to ecosystems of interconnected embedded computers (Musical Things) enabling users to produce, interact with or experience musical content. Musical Things embed electronics, sensors, data forwarding and processing software into physical or virtual objects. Smart musical instruments (SMIs) are an emerging class of Musical Things provided with capabilities of capturing and receiving data supporting instrumental musical practice. Due to their portability and self-containdeness, SMIs enable novel ubiquitous interactions between performers of acoustic and digital musical instruments. After a review of current trends in SMI research, we propose an ubiquitous smart guitar system which uses the guitar as a hub for collaborative music making. We then present a survey conducted with 18 performers to assess the usability, creativity support and engagement with the system. Results show a positive emotional engagement with the system which overall was found easy to use and novel. We also discuss several barriers to creative interaction related to the size of the user interface, creative agency and personalisation.},

	abstract = {The Internet of Musical Things (IoMusT) is an emerging research ﬁeld positioned at the intersection of Internet of Things, new interfaces for musical expression, ubiquitous music, human–computer interaction, artiﬁcial intelligence, and participatory art. From a computer science perspective, IoMusT refers to the networks of computing devices embedded in physical objects (musical things) dedicated to the production and/or reception of musical content. Musical things, such as smart musical instruments or wearables, are connected by an infrastructure that enables multidirectional communication, both locally and remotely. We present a vision in which the IoMusT enables the connection of digital and physical domains by means of appropriate information and communication technologies, fostering novel musical applications and services. The ecosystems associated with the IoMusT include interoperable devices and services that connect musicians and audiences to support musician–musician, audience–musicians, and audience–audience interactions. In this paper, we ﬁrst propose a vision for the IoMusT and its motivations. We then discuss ﬁve scenarios illustrating how the IoMusT could support: 1) augmented and immersive concert experiences; 2) audience participation; 3) remote rehearsals; 4) music e-learning; and 5) smart studio production. We identify key capabilities missing from today’s systems and discuss the research needed to develop these capabilities across a set of interdisciplinary challenges. These encompass network communication (e.g., ultra-low latency and security), music information research (e.g., artiﬁcial intelligence for real-time audio content description and multimodal sensing), music interaction (e.g., distributed performance and music e-learning), as well as legal and responsible innovation aspects to ensure that future IoMusT services are socially desirable and undertaken in the public interest.},

The key question of the relationship between gesture, instrument and sound is approached via an analysis of the electric guitar’s design, playing technique and interface characteristics. The study points out some inherent defaults in the guitar’s current forms of acoustic-electric hybridation, as well as new perspectives for a better integration of the relationship between instrumental gesture and signal processing. These considerations motivate an augmented guitar project at the CICM, in which a gestural approach to augmentation is developed, emphasising the role of the instrumentist’s repertoire of body movements as a source for new gesture-sound « contact points » in the guitar playing technique.},

In recent years, there has been increasing interest in using feature learning and deep architectures instead, thus reducing the required engineering effort and the need for prior knowledge. However, this new approach typically still relies on mid-level representations of music audio, e.g. spectrograms, instead of raw audio signals. In this paper, we investigate whether it is possible to apply feature learning directly to raw audio signals. We train convolutional neural networks using both approaches and compare their performance on an automatic tagging task. Although they do not outperform a spectrogram-based approach, the networks are able to autonomously discover frequency decompositions from raw audio, as well as phase-and translation-invariant feature representations.},

	abstract = {This textbook provides both profound technological knowledge and a comprehensive treatment of essential topics in music processing and music information retrieval. Including numerous examples, figures, and exercises, this book is suited for students, lecturers, and researchers working in audio engineering, computer science, multimedia, and musicology.The book consists of eight chapters. The first two cover foundations of music representations and the Fourier transform―concepts that are then used throughout the book. In the subsequent chapters, concrete music processing tasks serve as a starting point. Each of these chapters is organized in a similar fashion and starts with a general description of the music processing scenario at hand before integrating it into a wider context. It then discusses―in a mathematically rigorous way―important techniques and algorithms that are generally applicable to a wide range of analysis, classification, and retrieval problems. At the same time, the techniques are directly applied to a specific music processing task. By mixing theory and practice, the book’s goal is to offer detailed technological insights as well as a deep understanding of music processing applications. Each chapter ends with a section that includes links to the research literature, suggestions for further reading, a list of references, and exercises. The chapters are organized in a modular fashion, thus offering lecturers and readers many ways to choose, rearrange or supplement the material. Accordingly, selected chapters or individual sections can easily be integrated into courses on general multimedia, information science, signal processing, music informatics, or the digital humanities.},

They treat it as a craft. They are professionals.   In The Clean Coder: A Code of Conduct for Professional Programmers, legendary software expert Robert C. Martin introduces the disciplines, techniques, tools, and practices of true software craftsmanship. This book is packed with practical advice–about everything from estimating and coding to refactoring and testing. It covers much more than technique: It is about attitude. Martin shows how to approach software development with honor, self-respect, and pride; work well and work clean; communicate and estimate faithfully; face difficult decisions with clarity and honesty; and understand that deep knowledge comes with a responsibility to act.   Readers will learn  What it means to behave as a true software craftsman  How to deal with conflict, tight schedules, and unreasonable managers  How to get into the flow of coding, and get past writer’s block  How to handle unrelenting pressure and avoid burnout  How to combine enduring attitudes with new development paradigms  How to manage your time, and avoid blind alleys, marshes, bogs, and swamps  How to foster environments where programmers and teams can thrive  When to say “No”–and how to say it  When to say “Yes”–and what yes really means    Great software is something to marvel at: powerful, elegant, functional, a pleasure to work with as both a developer and as a user. Great software isn’t written by machines. It is written by professionals with an unshakable commitment to craftsmanship. The Clean Coder will help you become one of them–and earn the pride and fulfillment that they alone possess.},

Typically bedroom producers use accessible digital technology that costs less than the equipment in a professional studio, such as MIDI controller-based instruments and virtual studio technology (software synthesized instruments and digital effects), to create music for release to the world. While a traditional record producer oversees and guides the recording process, often working alongside multiple people such as studio musicians, singers, engineers, mixers, songwriters, arrangers, and orchestrators, a bedroom producer does everything independently: creating the ideas, recording them and processing them for release. Bedroom producers are often self-taught, learning sound design, mixing and music theory by reading music production blogs and watching tutorials on the internet. As bedroom producers depend on the accessibility of music technology, bedroom production has been made easier with advances in home computing power and digital audio workstations (DAW).},

	abstract = {A bedroom producer is a musician who creates, performs, and records their music independently using a home studio, either as a profession or as a hobby. Typically bedroom producers use accessible digital technology that costs less than the equipment in a professional studio, such as MIDI controller-based instruments and virtual studio technology (software synthesized instruments and digital effects), to create music for release to the world. While a traditional record producer oversees and guides the recording process, often working alongside multiple people such as studio musicians, singers, engineers, mixers, songwriters, arrangers, and orchestrators, a bedroom producer does everything independently: creating the ideas, recording them and processing them for release. Bedroom producers are often self-taught, learning sound design, mixing and music theory by reading music production blogs and watching tutorials on the internet. As bedroom producers depend on the accessibility of music technology, bedroom production has been made easier with advances in home computing power and digital audio workstations (DAW).},

Now available in a completely revised fourth edition, The Mixing Engineer’s Handbook remains the best, most up-to-date source for mastering the art and science of creating pro-quality mixes Topics covered include:    * The six elements of a mix, from achieving balance to creating interest    * The secrets of equalization and “magic frequencies”    * Advanced techniques expected of today’s mixer, like track cleanup, adjusting track timing, pitch correction, sound replacement, and automation tricks    * Easy-to-grasp methods for adding effects, sonic layering, calculating delay, and much more The book also features 25 interviews with some of the music industry’s most successful and celebrated audio engineers/producers/mixers, who share their expertise, insights, and philosophies about mixing. Learn the art of mixing from start to finish, and pick up tips and techniques from the pros, with The Mixing Engineer’s Handbook, Fourth Edition.},

A vision for the future is vitally important for contemporary business firms, establishing a strategic horizon against which short- and longterm organizational goals and objectives can be measured. Creativity may simply be defined as using the imagination in designing and actualizing organizational production. The institutionalization of creativity, or creativity management, is becoming ever more possible as the nature of innovativeness is better understood. Institutionalizing creativity involves deliberate modification of organizational culture in orientation toward the future, consistent with organizational vision as well as mission, as well as leadership and entrepreneurship.

We used an incubation paradigm to assess whether performance on validated creativity problems (the Unusual Uses Task, or UUT) can be facilitated by engaging in either a demanding task or an undemanding task that maximizes mind wandering. Compared with engaging in a demanding task, rest, or no break, engaging in an undemanding task during an incubation period led to substantial improvements in performance on previously encountered problems. Critically, the context that improved performance after the incubation period was associated with higher levels of mind wandering but not with a greater number of explicitly directed thoughts about the UUT. These data suggest that engaging in simple external tasks that allow the mind to wander may facilitate creative problem solving.]},

They were referred for necropsy and dead due to non-digestive causes. 4 males and 6 females were examined. The ages were classified of 4-16 years old. The stomach and gastric mucosa was evaluated for classified Merrit, 2003. Samples of gastric tissue were collected. The samples fixed in formalin were processed by conventional histological techniques and examined by histopathology. None of the donkeys presented clinical signs for gastric ulcers syndrome. Of the 10 donkeys studied, 10\% had Grade 0; 30\% Grade 1; 40\% Grade 2; 10\% Grade 3; and 10\% Grade 4. In 30\% (3/10) parasites such as Gasterophilus sp. were observed. The histological slices revealed severe damage on the gastric mucosa, a loss of continuity of the gastric mucosa with corium exposure, and subchorionic edema with parakeratotic hyperkeratosis, together with a mixed lymphoplasmocytic mononuclear infiltrate. In conclusion, we reported gastric ulcers syndrome in donkeys in Spain.},

	abstract = {The efficacy of a paste formulation of the H+, K+, -ATPase inhibitor omeprazole was evaluated in standardbred racehorses for the treatment and prevention of gastric ulcers. Twenty standardbred racehorses in training, aged 2 to 9 years, were enrolled from 2 training centres in this field trial. Endoscopic examinations confirmed the presence of gastric ulcers in all horses, prior to allocation and treatment and on day 0. Lesions were scored on a scale of 0 to 3 (intact epithelium to extensive ulceration). Replicates were formed, based on training level and location. Within replicates, 1 horse was assigned to group 1 and 3 horses were assigned to group 2, randomly. Horses in group 1 were sham-dosed controls. Horses in group 2 were given omeprazole paste orally at 4 mg/kg bodyweight (BW)/day from day 0 to day 27 and 2 mg/kg BW/day of omeprazole paste orally from day 28 to day 57. Follow-up endoscopies were conducted on post treatment days 28 and 58 or 59. Physical examinations, including BWs, were conducted on all horses prior to treatment and on days 13 or 14, 28, 42 or 43, and 58 or 59. Horses treated with omeprazole had significantly (P {\textless} 0.01) more improvement in gastric lesion scores than did controls at day 28 and at study termination on days 58 or 59. All of the omeprazole-treated horses were improved relative to baseline ulcer score at both examinations, and 73.3\% were healed (lesion score of 0) at both examinations. None of the controls improved at any point during the study. When the dose was reduced to 2 mg/kg BW, 80\% of the horses showed no recurrences or worsening in gastric ulcers. It was concluded that omeprazole paste at 4 mg/kg BW orally, once daily is highly effective in healing gastric ulcers in standardbred racehorses in training and that a dose of 2 mg/kg BW orally, once daily, effectively prevents the recurrence of gastric ulcers in most horses.},

	shorttitle = {A comparison of three doses of omeprazole in the treatment of equine gastric ulcer syndrome},
	doi = {10.1111/evj.12287},
	abstract = {REASONS FOR PERFORMING THE STUDY: A previous study demonstrated that a dose effect between 1.6 and 4.0 mg/kg bwt of omeprazole per os s.i.d. is present in the treatment of equine gastric ulceration. In the same study, healing of glandular ulceration appeared inferior to healing of squamous ulceration. However, several limitations were recognised in that study and further investigation is warranted.
OBJECTIVES: To further investigate the presence of a dose relationship in the treatment of gastric ulceration under conditions that may favour omeprazole efficacy such as administration prior to exercise and after a brief fast, and potential differences between the response of squamous and glandular ulceration to omeprazole therapy.
STUDY DESIGN: A blinded, randomised, dose-response clinical trial.
METHODS: Sixty Thoroughbred racehorses with grade ≥2/4 squamous and/or glandular ulceration were identified by gastroscopy. Horses were randomly assigned to receive either 1.0, 2.0 or 4.0 mg/kg bwt of enteric coated omeprazole per os s.i.d. 1-4 h prior to exercise. Gastroscopy was repeated at approximately 28 days.
RESULTS: The lower doses studied (1.0 and 2.0 mg/kg bwt) were noninferior to the reference dose (4.0 mg/kg bwt) in the treatment of squamous ulceration. Healing was greater in squamous ulceration than glandular ulceration (86\% vs. 14\%; P{\textless}0.0001). Improvement in ulcer grade was more likely in squamous lesions than glandular lesions (96\% vs. 34\%; P{\textless}0.0001). Worsening of the glandular ulcer grade was observed in 36\% of horses.
CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest that, under the conditions studied, where omeprazole is administered before exercise and following a brief fast, doses of omeprazole as low as 1 mg/kg bwt per os s.i.d. may be as effective as higher doses. The proportion of glandular ulceration that heals with 28 days of omeprazole therapy is less than that of squamous ulceration.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine the minimal effective dosage of omeprazole oral paste for the prevention of naturally occurring ulcers in horses starting race training.
DESIGN: Prospective study.
ANIMALS: 175 horses.
PROCEDURE: Horses in the dose selection portion of the study were sham dose treated or received 1 mg (0.45 mg/lb) or 2 mg (0.9 mg/lb) of omeprazole/kg, PO, every 24 hours for 28 days or 4 mg of omeprazole/kg (1.8 mg/lb; loading dose), PO, every 24 hours for 4 days, then 1 or 2 mg of omeprazole/kg, PO, every 24 hours for 24 days. Horses in the dose confirmation portion of the study were sham dose treated or received 1 mg of omeprazole/kg, PO, every 24 hours for 28 days. Gastric ulcer scores at the beginning and end of the study were compared.
RESULTS: Sham-dose-treated horses had significantly higher ulcer scores than did horses treated with any of the omeprazole dosages evaluated. Among horses treated with omeprazole, there was no significant interaction of dose (1 or 2 mg/kg) and loading dose; therefore, the lowest effective dose (1 mg/kg) was evaluated in the dose confirmation portion of the study. In the dose confirmation study, 4 of 39 (10\%) sham-dose-treated horses remained ulcer free, which was significantly different from the proportion of horses (31/38 [82\%]) receiving 1 mg of omeprazole/kg that remained ulcer free. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE; Results indicated that omeprazole administered at a dosage of 1 mg/kg, PO, every 24 hours for 28 days was effective for prevention of gastric ulcers in horses starting race training.},

	volume = {55},

	doi = {10.1080/00480169.2007.36729},
	abstract = {AIM: To establish the prevalence and factors influencing the prevalence and severity of gastric ulceration in racehorses in New Zealand.
METHODS: Horses (n=171) in active training for racing by trainers (n=24) located throughout New Zealand were examined using gastroscopy during 2003 and 2004. Images of the examination were recorded and reviewed, and an ordinal grade based on the severity of gastric ulceration present was assigned, using the grading system proposed by the Equine Gastric Ulcer Council (EGUC). Information about the horses such as age, breed, sex, stabling, time at pasture, pasture quality, and presence of clinical signs consistent with equine gastric ulcer syndrome (EGUS) was recorded.
RESULTS: Of the 171 horses in the study, 133 (78\%) were Thoroughbreds and 38 (22\%) were Standardbreds. Evidence of gastric ulceration was present in 151 (88.3\%) of these. Prevalence of ulceration was higher at the lesser curvature (LC) and greater curvature (GC) of the stomach than at the saccus caecus (SC; p{\textless}0.01), and ulceration was more severe at the LC than at either the GC (p=0.02) or the SC (p{\textless}0.001). The prevalence of ulceration did not differ between the two breeds (p=0.51) or between horses of differing ages (p=0.56). Gastric ulceration was evident in 125/141 (89\%) horses kept at pasture for at least 4 h/day, in all 13 (100\%) horses kept at pasture full time, and in 16/17 (94\%) horses stabled full time. Prevalence and severity of ulceration did not differ between horses stabled full time, kept at pasture for part of the day or kept at pasture full time (p=0.33 and 0.13, respectively), and for horses grazed on pasture severity of ulceration did not vary significantly with the quality of the pasture (p=0.12). Neither prevalence (p=0.26) nor severity (p=0.49) of gastric ulceration varied significantly with duration of training.
CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of gastric ulceration in racehorses in New Zealand is similar to that reported elsewhere for horses in active training for racing. Access to pasture for some or all of the day did not appear to be protective.},

However, this perspective fails to account for the reality that human creativity is also often the result of internal motivations having nothing to do with money. This book addresses what motivates human creativity and how the law governing authors\&\#39; rights should be shaped in response to these motivations.  On a practical level, it illustrates how integrating a fuller appreciation of the inspirational dimension of the creative process will allow us to think more expansively about legal protections for authors. Many types of creators currently lack the legal ability to compel attribution for their work, to prevent misattribution, and to safeguard their work from unwanted modifications. Drawing from a number of diverse sources, including literary, philosophical, and religious works, this book offers real solutions for crafting legal measures that facilitate an author\&\#39;s ability to safeguard his or her work without entirely sacrificing the intellectual property policies in practice in the United States today.},
