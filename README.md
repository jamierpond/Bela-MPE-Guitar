# Bela-MPE-Guitar
We explore the development of a prototype MIDI Polyphonic Expression (MPE) enabled, guitar-like instrument for use in the modern music production studio. Following a process of human-centred design and human-computer interaction, we focus on creating a prototype that is conducive to fostering creative flow. This is achieved through the implementation of capacitive touch sensors (Bela Trill Bar) which are affixed to the frets of the prototype, which offers affordances of polyphonic aftertouch and pitch bend. The data thereof is interpreted with a given mathematical and programming framework. We find that the prototype is proficient at supporting novel creative musical ideas and subjectively pleasingly idiosyncratic musical performances, however this is somewhat impeded by practical prototyping choices.
