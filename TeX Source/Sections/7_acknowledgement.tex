\section*{Acknowledgement}
I would like to thank everyone in the \textbf{\href{http://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/}{C4DM}} at QMUL, each of which in their own way has helped to inform my understanding and interest in digital audio, music and human-centred design. In particular Mathieu Barthet, Andrew McPherson, Paul Curzon and Sophie Skatch who have all been instrumental in supporting my learning in the modules they teach. 

In particular, Mathieu Barthet has been an extremely attentive and supportive supervisor to this project and I thank him immensely for his support on this journey.
