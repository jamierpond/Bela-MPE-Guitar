\section{Summary and Conclusion}

To conclude, we have explored how capacitive touch sensors can be applied to the guitar to create an expressive MPE instrument. The interaction design for this instrument is not yet perfected, but offers a direction for further development.

We have proposed a framework for mathematically interpreting the sensor data which can scale to any number of frets or strings, which means that this system can scale indefinitely to accommodate any sized system.

We have evaluated how the prototype is overall effective in delivering the desired expressive features, but requires some refinement to be truly creatively liberating.
